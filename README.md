This extension has been designed to help developers to manipulateÂ  z/OS environment files, and for those teams have adopted the open source software for z/OS development and DevOps under IBM z platform. Provides fully hexadecimal integration and EBCDIC support for sequential data sets, allowing to load a Copybook (Layout) from your application repository or even the same MVS system (Using Zore Explore). The files are unload to the local system to increase the performance and can be sincronized with the z/OS system once the changes has completed.

## Features

- Read, Edit and Write EBCDIC (datasets) files
- Hexadecimal conversion
- Apply Layouts using Copybooks
  - Alpha-Numeric Supprot
  - Display Support
  - Binary Support

## Requirements

- To use the z/OS connection capabilities, it is required to have configured a ZOWE profile. A ZOWE profile, in turn, requires the mainframe to have "zosmf" or "rse api".
